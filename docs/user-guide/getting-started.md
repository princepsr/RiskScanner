# Getting Started with Risk Scanner

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Java 21** (JDK) installed
- **Windows, macOS, or Linux** operating system
- **Project path** - Local directory containing a Maven (`pom.xml`) or Gradle (`build.gradle`/`build.gradle.kts`) project
- (Optional) **AI API key** for enhanced analysis (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Ollama, or Azure)

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the Application

```powershell
# Using Maven wrapper (Windows)
.\mvnw spring-boot:run

# Using Maven wrapper (macOS/Linux)
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`

### 2. Open the Web Interface

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

### 3. Run Your First Analysis

1. **Select Build Tool**: Choose Maven or Gradle from the radio buttons
2. **Enter Project Path**: Type or paste the full path to your project directory
   - Example: `C:\Users\YourName\Projects\my-java-app`
   - The tool will automatically find `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`
3. **(Optional) Enable AI**: Check "Enable AI-assisted analysis" and enter your API key
4. **Click "Analyze Dependencies"**: The scan will begin

### 4. View Results

Once complete, you'll see:
- **KPI Cards**: Total dependencies, vulnerabilities by severity, overall risk score
- **Findings Table**: Detailed vulnerability list with filters
- **Analysis Section**: Severity distribution and recommendations

## Understanding the Results

### KPI Cards

| Card | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Total dependencies** | All dependencies found (direct + transitive) |
| **Vulnerabilities found** | Dependencies with known CVEs |
| **Critical** | 10+ CVEs or critical severity |
| **High** | 5-9 high severity CVEs |
| **Medium** | 2-4 medium severity CVEs |
| **Low** | 0-1 low severity CVEs |
| **Overall risk score** | 0-100 score representing current view risk |

### Risk Score Interpretation

The risk score (0-100) uses a **critical-dominance algorithm**:

- **0-20**: Low risk - No critical vulnerabilities
- **21-40**: Medium risk - May have 1 critical vulnerability
- **41-60**: High risk - Multiple critical vulnerabilities or many highs
- **61-90**: Critical risk - Several critical vulnerabilities
- **91-100**: Severe risk - Many critical vulnerabilities

**Important**: The score is calculated from the **current filtered view**, not the entire project.

### Severity Classification

| Severity | CVE Count | Risk Level |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| Critical | 10+ | Immediate attention required |
| High | 5-9 | Address soon |
| Medium | 2-4 | Plan to fix |
| Low | 0-1 | Monitor |

## Using Filters

The findings table supports multiple filters:

### Search Box
- Filter by dependency name (e.g., "spring", "log4j")
- Real-time filtering as you type
- Case-insensitive matching

### Severity Filter
- All, Critical, High, Medium, Low
- Shows only matching severities

### Directness Filter
- **All**: Direct and transitive dependencies
- **Direct**: Only dependencies declared in your build file
- **Transitive**: Only dependencies pulled in by others

### Confidence Filter
- **All**: All confidence levels
- **High**: Maven projects (reliable resolution)
- **Medium**: Gradle projects (best-effort)

## Loading Cached Results

If you've analyzed a project before:

1. Enter the same project path
2. Click **"Load Cached"** button
3. Results will load instantly from local database

**Note**: Cached results are scoped by AI provider/model. Different providers = separate caches.

## Exporting Results

Click **"Export CSV"** button to download findings as a CSV file with columns:
- Dependency name and version
- CVE count and IDs
- Severity level
- Risk score per vulnerability
- Confidence and directness
- Description and recommendations

## AI Configuration (Optional)

### Enabling AI Analysis

1. Check **"Enable AI-assisted analysis"**
2. Select your **Provider**: OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Ollama, or Azure
3. Enter your **API Key**
4. (Optional) Select specific **Model**

### Supported Providers

| Provider | Recommended Models |
|----------|-------------------|
| **OpenAI** | gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o |
| **Claude** | claude-3-5-sonnet, claude-3-opus |
| **Gemini** | gemini-pro, gemini-1.5-pro |
| **Ollama** | llama3, mistral (local) |
| **Azure** | Your deployed model name |

### AI Features

When enabled, AI provides:
- **Risk explanations** in plain English
- **Impact assessment** - How the vulnerability affects your project
- **Remediation advice** - Specific steps to fix
- **Contextual analysis** - Why this matters for your specific dependency

### Security Note

- Only dependency names and vulnerability data are sent to AI providers
- **No source code** or proprietary information is shared
- API keys are **encrypted at rest** (when encryption secret is configured)

## Build Tool Specifics

### Maven Projects

- **Confidence**: HIGH - Uses Maven Resolver for accurate dependency trees
- **Features**: Full transitive resolution, scope information, reliable results
- **Requirements**: `pom.xml` in project directory

### Gradle Projects

- **Confidence**: MEDIUM - Parses build file output (best-effort)
- **Note**: Some false positives may occur due to dynamic resolution
- **Requirements**: `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` in project directory

### Multi-Module Projects

Point to the **parent project directory**. The tool will:
- Detect the build file type
- Attempt to analyze all modules
- Aggregate findings across the project
